# Sufrah - Restaurant Ordering App

## About Sufrah

Sufrah is a user-friendly restaurant ordering app designed to simplify the process of choosing a restaurant, viewing menus, and placing pickup orders. Customers can browse through available restaurants, select their desired dishes, and place orders for pickup. On the other hand, restaurant admins can manage orders by updating their status (e.g., pending, cooking, or ready for pickup) and providing feedback to customers.
